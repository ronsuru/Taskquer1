# Social Media Connection Setup

This document explains how the social media connection works in the Taskquer mini-app.

## Overview

The social media section now allows users to connect their own social media accounts directly. When users tap "Connect" on any platform, they'll be redirected to the platform's login page where they can authenticate with their own credentials.

## No Setup Required! ðŸŽ‰

**No environment variables or OAuth credentials needed!** Users connect their own social media accounts directly.

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. **Tap "Connect"** â†’ User is redirected to the platform's login page
2. **User logs in** â†’ User authenticates with their own credentials
3. **Return to app** â†’ User returns and sees their account as connected
4. **Account linked** â†’ Social media account is now connected to their profile

### Supported Platforms
- **Facebook** â†’ Redirects to facebook.com/login
- **Twitter** â†’ Redirects to twitter.com/i/flow/login  
- **YouTube** â†’ Redirects to accounts.google.com/signin (YouTube service)
- **Discord** â†’ Redirects to discord.com/login
- **TikTok** â†’ Redirects to tiktok.com/login

## Demo Mode

For demonstration purposes, the app simulates successful connections after users are redirected to the platform login pages. In a production environment, you would implement proper account verification and linking through your backend.
